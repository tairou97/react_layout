# Band landing page

This exercise is about practicing react-router. Complete this small React app for your favorite band.

## Tasks

- Implement a navigation menu for your app with at least four items
  - For example vocals, bass, guitar, and drums
- Use [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/) package to handle navigation within your app
- It's not required to implement transitions between pages
- Choose images of your favorite music band for each navigation item
  - The image file names should include the name of the corresponding navigation item
  - For example `guitar-example.png`, `vocals.png`, etc
- Create a `<main>` container element that will hold a single image
- When a user clicks on a nav item, the app should navigate to a path including the name of the item
  - For example `/vocals`, `/bass`, `/guitar` and `/drums`
  - The image in `<main>` changes corresponding to the new path
